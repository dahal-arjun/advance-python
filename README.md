Advance Python

##### few topics
We will deep dive into the following topics and make use of our skill to tackle the problems.<br>
1. Copy, Deep Copy and other basics (builtin methods, magic methods) etc. <br>
2. Decorators<br>
3. Generators<br>
4. Context Managers <br>
5. Metaclasses <br>
6. Parallel Processing and Multi Processing
7. OOP <br>
8. Design Patterns <br>
9. Maybe More,I don't even know how much I don't know will add more as i will get more information in future.

Trying to understand what's important and My mindset before starting to work in this project.<br>
I always believe we should have few qustions before starting anything and they are:<br>

1. Why are we doing this? 
2. What's the purpose of the work?
3. What is my expected result?

Addressing, Why i am doing this?
Learning is never ending process. I am trying to expand my knowledge about the python.<br>
The only way I can be better at something is by following few principles<br>
1. Reading and Understaing it.
2. Applying it.
3. Doing it Everyday.

What's the purpose of the work?
I would like to understand the internals of the python, expand the knowledge and use this as refrence<br>
for my future. I want to understand the power of imporving everyday the continous and small efforts<br>

What is my expected result?
Being better than today, when I look back, I should have some more knowledge and a bit more idea about how much I don't know<br>
Right now its like walking on dark road with the help of a small matchstick and limited visibility<br>
Would love to widen the visibility and see other unseen things.
